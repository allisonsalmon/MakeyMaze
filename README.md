Making mazes with the Makey Makey!
===================================

A simple script for timing how long it takes to make it through the maze and
how many errors, either straying from the path or touching the path, were made while
navigating the maze.

The first version was written in C# using Unity 3D.

Second version will be in javascript.

Current work
============
* convert to javascript
* add alert sound for errors
* make it prettier looking

Future work
============
* score history for session
* high score for session
